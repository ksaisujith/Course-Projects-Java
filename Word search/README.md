Given is a file, each line of the file has a single word. A word consist of printable, visible characters. You have to read the file and print the word, if the word has specific properties, like being a palindrome. You have to the pattern class to determine if a word has a specific property, and you have to write your own method to determine if a word has a specific property.

You have to test each word, i.e. each line, for the following properties:

•

´a’ is part of the word.

•

Palindrome anchored at the beginning and end of line.

•

Include a palindrome which is 2 characters long.

•

Include a palindrome which is 3 characters long.

•

The word has at least one ’a’ in it.

•

The word consist only of ’a’s or ’b’s.

•

´a’s or ’b’s can not be part of the word.

•

The word is == ’.’.

•

The word includes a ’.’.

Explanation: 
Let assume the file is:

a
aba
abb
cd
Hello World.
•

´a’ has an ’a’ as part of the word.

•

´a’ is a palindrome anchored at the beginning and end of line

•

´abb’ includes a palindrome which is 2 characters long

•

´cd’ is a word which does not include ’a’s or ’b’s.

•

´.’ is == to ’.’.
