# Bank Application

More generally there are different types of accounts,

Asset accounts

Asset accounts include bank accounts like checking or savings: Deposits are debits. Withdrawals are credits.

Liability accounts

Loans and credit cards are liability accounts. Received payments (transactions "paying off" your credit card) are debits. Expenses/purchases are credits.

Each account must have a unique account number.

In the example you will see that you need to be able to pass time which will apply interest to each account in the bank. Interest rates must be different for each account type. You must be able to open, close, debit and credit (remember they mean different things for different accounts)

You can make the assumption that input to the program will be valid.

See below for example run of a program where an account is opened and a bank summary is shown for all open accounts. Another account is opened and 3 months pass. You will notice that a credit card bill is sent each month that passes after interest is applied.
