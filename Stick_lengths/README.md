# Stick formation

Given a set of sticks S, with |S| = n. The set of the lengths of the sticks are:
s= {s1,s2,s3....}

Given is a stick s_new, with length l; does a combination of elemenets of s exist so such



If such a set exist print out one set.<br>

Explanation: <br>
Assume give is the following set S = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 } and s_new, with length 5.<br>
The following combinations would add up to the lenght of 5:<br>

• 1 + 4 = 5 <br>
• 2 + 3 = 5 <br>

Program Work like below: 
A 1 inch, 2 inch stick would add up to a stick of 3 length, a 1 inch, 2 inch, and 2 inch stick could add up to a stick of 
length 5 and 4.


You have sticks with the following lengths: 1 inch, 5 inch, 8 inch, 12 inch, 12 inch, 35 inch, 35 inch, 35 inch, and 61 inch.

This program determines if a combination for f2s_new = 1, 6, 9, 24, 110, 111, 115, 62, 24, 202, 203, 204, 205 exist.<br>

Example:<br>

An example of a solution execution:<br>

java Sticks <br>
3 inch:        yes; used sickLengths = 3 inch<br>
5 inch:        yes; used sickLengths = 5 inch
